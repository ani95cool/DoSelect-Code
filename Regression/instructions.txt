Instructions:
1. Please run this on anaconda as the libraries like numpy and pandas are preinstalled on anaconda but are not there in omega
2. for the program Logistic regression please input a set of points or samples as I have made it easy for the TA to run it. You 
will have to keep inputting the points till it reaches your number of samples n.
3. For the linear regression programs you just have to input the order of the polynomial k. The outputs are from there self explonatory.
4. In the linear regression programs we compute the value of the function p(x) using the cost and gradient descent function.
5. In the logistic regression program I have computed the sigmoid function and the hypothesis and if the value of the sigmoid function
is greater than 0.5 then it is W else it is M.
6. The logistic regression program covers both 2a and 2b combined.
